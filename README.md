# Shop Robbery Script for FiveM -- QBCore

This script is a simple shop robbery script created by SeriumTW. It is provided for free, as there is a lack of decent shop robbery scripts available.

## Installation

1. Download the script files.
2. Place the script folder in the resources directory of your FiveM server.
3. Add the following line to your server.cfg file:

```markdown
   ensure shoprobbery
```

4. Restart your FiveM server.

## Usage

To initiate a shop robbery, players need to enter a designated shop location and press the interaction key (default: "E"). Once the robbery is started, a notification will be sent to the police using the "ps-dispatch" script ([ps-dispatch](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-dispatch)). Players must then wait for the robbery duration to complete.

During the robbery, players will receive rewards based on the configuration settings. The rewards may include items such as "ssd16tb" (example item name). The duration and cooldown of the robbery can be customized in the configuration file.

## Configuration

The script includes a configuration file where you can customize various settings such as the minimum number of police required, robbery locations, rewards, cooldown duration, and more. Please refer to the configuration section in the script file to make any necessary adjustments.

## Dependencies

- QBCore Framework: Make sure you have QBCore properly installed and functioning on your FiveM server.

You can find the ps-dispatch script on GitHub at the following link: [ps-dispatch](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-dispatch).
